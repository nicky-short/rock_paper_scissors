Hello!  Init. commit for this will be the index.html file, with the script.js linked.  Will update with plan.

1.  for "getComputerChoice" I will use the math.random fucntion, multiplied it by 3, add 1, and round down to the nearest integer.
    - this will give me a random number generation of 1, 2, or 3.
        - 1 will be ROCK
        - 2 will be PAPER
        - 3 will be scissors
