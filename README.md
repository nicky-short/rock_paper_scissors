TOP Project #2 - Rock Paper Scissors!


Hello!  Init. commit for this will be the index.html file, with the script.js linked.  Will update with plan.

1.  for "getComputerChoice" I will use the math.random fucntion, multiplied it by 3, add 1, and round down to the nearest integer.
    - this will give me the computerChoice, a random number generation of 1, 2, or 3.
        - 1 will be rock
        - 2 will be paper
        - 3 will be scissors
2. Site will prompt user to enter Rock/Paper/Scissors, and will log result as the humanChoice.  will be lowercased to match computerchoice
3. Game logic of RPS will be declared in the "playround" function -->rules for who will win are in here
4. playGame function will direct program to play 5 rounds, and increment human and computer scores depending on winner
5. winner of the 5 round game will be announced (logged) at the end of the 5 rounds
